Simple settings page to allocate multiple roles to a user.

== Description ==

There are lots of plugins to handle roles and capabilities, however, none seem to provide a simple interface for multiple roles to be assigned only.

This plug plugin expects the complexity of capabilities to be handled by other plugins and the site Administrator, but provides any user with the 'promote_users' capability a way to handle allocation of roles.

So by simply creating a new role, for example "staff" and adding the 'promote_users' capability to this role, all staff members will be able to handle role assignment.  
 

Also ( coming soon )  if you wish to hide/mask-out a particular role from "staff" ( such as "Administrator" ) then you can exclude these using the "role excluder" plugin available over at [justinandco.com](https://justinandco.com/plugins/)
